# Programming Assignment Functions loops and data structures

Introduction
In this lab, you will create a menu ordering system that allows users to select three items from a predefined menu. You will implement functions to calculate the total bill, including tax, and display the order summary.

Objectives
Create new functions to solve specific problems.

Gain experience of using for loops to iterate over different data collections.

Create and use data structures to store, retrieve and loop over data.

Learner Instructions:
Step 1: Open the ordering_system.py script present under the PROJECT folder.  

Step 2: Navigate to Terminal > New Terminal and execute the python3 ordering_system.py command to run the ordering_system.py script.

Step 3: Run the script and, when requested, enter the three products of your choice based on the menu (1 = espresso, 2 = coffee, etc.).  

Step 4: Extend the script to have a new function called calculate_subtotal.

It should accept one argument which is the order list and return the sum of the prices of the items in the order list.

Step 5: Implement calculate_tax(), which calculates the tax of the subtotal.  

 The tax percentage is 15% of the overall bill.  

Step 6: Implement summarize_order(), which returns a list of the names of the items that the customer ordered and the total amount (including tax) that they have to pay.  

 The orders should show the name and price.  

Step 7: After implementing the functions, navigate to File > Save to save the changes in the script.
